# BACKLOG

This backlog is problem-focused, not a task list.
If something already has a clear solution and steps, it probably belongs in PLAN.md instead.

## How to use this backlog

 • Each item describes a problem worth solving, not an implementation.
 • Keep items coarse-grained; details emerge during planning.
 • Reorder freely. Priority reflects current understanding, not commitment.

If the backlog grows large, that’s fine. Only a few items should ever be in active planning.

Keeping an icebox reduces pressure to act on every idea.

## Backlog hygiene

 • If an item repeatedly stalls planning, it probably hides a missing decision.
 • If an item keeps spawning many tasks, consider splitting the problem.
 • If an item hasn’t been relevant for a long time, move it to the icebox.
