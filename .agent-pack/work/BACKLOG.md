# BACKLOG

This backlog is problem-focused, not a task list.
If something already has a clear solution and steps, it probably belongs in PLAN.md instead.

## How to use this backlog

- Each item describes a problem worth solving, not an implementation.
- Keep items coarse-grained; details emerge during planning.
- Reorder freely. Priority reflects current understanding, not commitment.
- Milestone structure is recommended guidance, not a hard requirement.

## Recommended pattern (optional)

Use this pattern when milestones help sequencing:

- Milestone -> backlog items -> optional sub-tasks
- A backlog item can stay problem-only if decomposition is not needed yet.
- Sub-tasks in BACKLOG.md are optional planning hints; executable tasks belong in PLAN.md.

Example (replace this with your real project backlog before planning):

Agent note: This section is illustrative only. Do not keep it as-is once real backlog items exist.

- M01: Onboarding reliability
  - [ ] B001 -- New users drop off before completing first setup
    - Who is affected: first-time users and support team
    - Why it matters: users fail to activate and generate support load
    - Impact if solved: higher activation and fewer support tickets
    - Notes / constraints: avoid major UI redesign in first pass
    - Optional sub-tasks:
      - [ ] B001a -- Clarify setup error states
      - [ ] B001b -- Add setup completion telemetry

If the backlog grows large, that’s fine. Only a few items should ever be in active planning.

## Icebox

Ideas or problems that might never be addressed.

- `<problem or idea>`

Keeping an icebox reduces pressure to act on every idea.

## Backlog hygiene

- If an item repeatedly stalls planning, it probably hides a missing decision.
- If an item keeps spawning many tasks, consider splitting the problem.
- If milestones stop being useful, use a flat backlog for a while.
- If an item hasn’t been relevant for a long time, move it to the icebox.
