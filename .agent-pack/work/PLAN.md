# PLAN

This is a rolling, short-horizon plan.
It describes what we are doing next, not everything we might do.

If this file gets large or vague, the plan is too big.

⸻

## How to use this plan

 • Plans are created via /ap:plan and consumed via /ap:do.
 • A plan should cover days, not weeks.
 • Each task must be small, explicit, and verifiable.

When the plan is complete or stale, replace it with a new one.

⸻

## Plan goal

<What will be true when this plan is complete?>

This should be an observable state change, not “finish feature X”.

⸻

## Context snapshot

Relevant context pulled from PROJECT.md and DECISIONS.md.
 • Key constraints:
 • Relevant decisions:
 • Assumptions:

This section prevents context loss when the plan is executed later.

⸻

## Decisions needed

Unresolved decisions that must be answered before or during execution.
 • DN001 —
 • Options:
 • A:
 • B:
 • Default if unanswered:
 • Needs input from: <user / agent>

If a decision becomes durable, promote it to DECISIONS.md.

⸻

## Tasks

Each task should be executable in isolation.
 • T001 —
    • Scope:
    • Touches: <files / areas>
    • Done when:
    • Check: C001
 • T002 —
    • Scope:
    • Touches:
    • Done when:
    • Check: C002

Guidelines:
 • Prefer 1–5 tasks per plan.
 • If a task includes “and then…”, split it.

## Risks & gotchas

Known risks, edge cases, or things easy to get wrong.
 • <risk>
 • <risk>

This helps builders avoid re-discovering problems.

⸻

## Out of scope (for this plan)

Things explicitly not being handled in this iteration.
 • <item>

Keeping this list short reduces accidental scope creep.

⸻

## Plan status

 • Created:
 • Status: ☐ planned / ☐ in progress / ☐ complete / ☐ abandoned
 • Superseded by: <link or note, if applicable>
