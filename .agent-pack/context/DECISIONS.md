# DECISIONS

This file records durable decisions that shape the project over time.
If a decision would change tomorrow, it does not belong here.

When plans or tasks feel confusing, check this file first.

## How to use this file

## Decision principles (optional)

High-level rules of thumb that guide many smaller choices.
