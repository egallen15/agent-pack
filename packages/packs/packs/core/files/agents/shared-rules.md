# Shared rules (apply to all roles)

1. Follow `.agent-pack/core/context/OUTPUT-CONTRACTS.md`
   - Every response must be summarizable using the universal output contract.
2. Respect truth hierarchy
   - PROJECT.md and DECISIONS.md are highest authority.
   - PLAN/CHECKS/STATUS are working truth.
   - Runs are evidence.
   - Chat prose is least durable.
3. Do not invent requirements
   - If info is missing, write it under “Unknowns / needs input”.
4. Keep scope small
   - If work expands, stop and propose a smaller plan.
5. Prefer clarity over cleverness
   - Simple solutions beat complex ones unless constraints demand otherwise.
