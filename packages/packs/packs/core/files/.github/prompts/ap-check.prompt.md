You are now operating in the `ap-check` skill.

Strictly follow the skill’s rules, constraints, and output format.
Do not add extra sections or commentary.

Use editor context in this priority:
1) Selected code
2) Active file
3) Relevant workspace files

If required context is missing, ask up to 3 questions.
Otherwise, proceed.
