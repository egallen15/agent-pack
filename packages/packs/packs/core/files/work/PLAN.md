# PLAN

This is a rolling, short-horizon plan.
It describes what we are doing next, not everything we might do.

If this file gets large or vague, the plan is too big.

⸻

## How to use this plan

- Plans are created via /ap:plan and consumed via /ap:do.
- A plan should cover days, not weeks.
- Each task must be small, explicit, and verifiable.
- Plans may span one or more milestones when that is the smallest coherent scope.

When the plan is complete or stale, replace it with a new one.

⸻

## Scope links (recommended)

Link this plan back to the backlog for traceability.

- Active milestones: <M01> or <M01, M02>
- Backlog items in scope: <B001, B003>
- Why this scope shape: <why this is one milestone or cross-milestone>

This is guidance, not strict schema. Keep references clear and readable.

⸻

## Plan goal

<What will be true when this plan is complete?>

This should be an observable state change, not “finish feature X”.

⸻

## Context snapshot

Relevant context pulled from PROJECT.md and DECISIONS.md.

- Key constraints:
- Relevant decisions:
- Assumptions:

This section prevents context loss when the plan is executed later.

⸻

## Decisions needed

Unresolved decisions that must be answered before or during execution.

- DN001 —
- Options:
- A:
- B:
- Default if unanswered:
- Needs input from: <user / agent>

If a decision becomes durable, promote it to DECISIONS.md.

## Tasks

Each task should be executable in isolation.

- T001 —
  - Source backlog item: <B001>
  - Scope:
  - Touches: <files / areas>
  - Done when:
  - Check: C001
- T002 —
  - Source backlog item: <B001 or B003>
  - Scope:
  - Touches:
  - Done when:
  - Check: C002

Guidelines:

- Prefer 1–5 tasks per plan.
- If a task includes “and then…”, split it.
- Keep task/check IDs traceable, but exact format is repo convention.

## Risks & gotchas

Known risks, edge cases, or things easy to get wrong.

- `<risk>`
- `<risk>`

This helps builders avoid re-discovering problems.

⸻

## Out of scope (for this plan)

Things explicitly not being handled in this iteration.

- `<item>`

Keeping this list short reduces accidental scope creep.

⸻

## Plan status

- Created:
- Status: ☐ planned / ☐ in progress / ☐ complete / ☐ abandoned
- Superseded by: <link or note, if applicable>
